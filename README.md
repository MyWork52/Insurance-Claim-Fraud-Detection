Problem Statemetn :

   Business Case : 
          Insurance fraud is a huge problem in the industry. It's difficult to identify
          fraud claims. Machine Learning is in a unique position to help the Auto Insurance
          Industy with this problem. 
          
          In this project, we are provided a dataset which has the details of the insurance
          policy along with the customer details. It also has the details of the accident on
          the bais of which the claims have been made.
          
          In this example, we will be working with some auto insurance data to demonstrate how
          we can creat a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent 
          or not.
